Hi! I'm Pierre-Louis, and this is my blog.

I work as a software engineer by day and spend my free time exploring my passion for machine learning and math.

I have too many ideas on a wide range of topics, which often leaves me feeling burned out. This blog is one attempt to share some of those ideas whenever I find the time to write. If you happen to enjoy something you read here, Iâ€™d be thrilled! :)

Disclaimer: French is my first language, so you might come across some language mistakes along the way.
